        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>The myth of Perseus and Medusa is one of the oldest and most well-known stories from Greek mythology, dating back to at least the 7th century BCE. Perseus was born to Danaë, daughter of King Acrisius of Argos, after she was visited by Zeus in the form of a golden shower. Fearing a prophecy that his grandson would one day kill him, Acrisius imprisoned Danaë and her newborn son, Perseus, in a chest and cast them into the sea. They were saved by a fisherman and lived a quiet life until Perseus was forced to embark on a perilous quest by King Polydectes of Seriphos, who coveted his mother.

            Polydectes sent Perseus on an impossible mission: to bring back the head of the Gorgon Medusa, a deadly creature whose mere gaze could turn men to stone. Medusa, once a beautiful maiden, had been cursed by the goddess Athena after being defiled by Poseidon in one of her temples. Her hair was turned into venomous snakes, and her appearance became so monstrous that no one could look at her and survive. Perseus, however, was aided by the gods. Athena gave him a reflective shield, Hermes provided him with winged sandals to fly, and Hades gave him a helmet of invisibility. Armed with these gifts, Perseus set off on his fateful journey.
